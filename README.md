# Coding challenge - Append and Delete
You have two strings of lowercase English letters. You can perform two types of operations on the first string:

- Append a lowercase English letter to the end of the string.
- Delete the last character of the string. Performing this operation on an empty string results in an empty string.
Given an integer k, and two strings, s and t, determine whether or not you can convert s to t by performing exactly k of the above operations on s. If it's possible, print Yes. Otherwise, print No.
